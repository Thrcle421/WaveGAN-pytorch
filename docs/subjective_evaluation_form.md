## Part 1: Mean Opinion Score (MOS)

For each audio sample, please rate the following aspects on a scale of 1-5:

**Rating Scale:**

1. Very poor quality
2. Poor quality
3. Fair quality
4. Good quality
5. Excellent quality

## Part 2: Pair Comparison (AB Test)

For each pair of samples, please indicate which one you think is:

1. More realistic (sounds like it could be from a real instrument/source)
2. More musically coherent (follows musical structure and patterns)
3. Higher overall quality

## Part 4: Musical Analysis (For participants with musical background)

For each sample, please provide detailed feedback on:

1. **Harmonic Structure:** Does the sample follow harmonic patterns or contain dissonance?
2. **Rhythmic Coherence:** Is there a consistent rhythm or beat? Does it follow musical timing?
3. **Timbral Quality:** How would you describe the tone/timbre of the sounds?
4. **Musical Expression:** Does the sample contain elements of musical expression (dynamics, articulation)?

| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Sample 21 |                    |                    |                 |                    |          |
